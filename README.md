# OpenStudio

OpenStudio is freely distributed web based yoga studio software built upon OpenSource technology. 
OpenStudio will help you manage customers, subscriptions, class cards, schedule classes, plan events and more. 

Online payments are provided through [Mollie](https://www.mollie.com/en). Please refer to their website & support for current rates and questions about availability in your region.
The OpenStudio Mollie integration handles single payments for classes, class cards, events and invoices. Recurring payments are supported for subscriptions. The web2py scheduler has to be running to process recurring payments.

More information can be found on [www.openstudioproject.com](https://www.openstudioproject.com).

Although initially written for yoga studio, OpenStudio is now used by different kinds of organizations as well like dance studios or Buddhist centers. Basically any organization or business dealing with subscriptions, classes or events could benefit from using OpenStudio.
