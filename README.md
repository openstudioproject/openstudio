# End of life

As of 31-03-2023 OpenStudio is end of life and won't receive any updates or security fixes. All development has been stopped. 
It is no longer recommended to run this software.

# End of life announcement

The recent corona situation has had it's impact on many of OpenStudio's commercial users. This in turn has also had a big impact on this project. In short, due to a big drop in commercial requests, OpenStudio is currently in maintenance mode. No new features will be added and no major updates will be released. From 31-03-2023 all hosting and support services for OpenStudio will come to an end and this project will be archived.

For smaller organizations though, there is also some good news. The Costasiella project has been started. This project aims to offer a modern implementation of a subset of OpenStudio's features. This new platform is clearly aimed at smaller operations and might not suit all current OpenStudio users. That being said, there will be a migration path which can import most of the data from OpenStudio. 

Development on this new project can be followed here:
